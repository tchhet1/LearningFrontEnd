Serializing and Parsing JSON:
    - stringify(): converts specified value into JSON representation
    - parse(): converts JSON into an object.

Function expression: assigning a variable to the function.
    eg: var add = function (a, b) {
                    return a + b;
                }

Recursive Function: 
    - Recursion is a method of function calling in which a function calls itself during execution.
    - Base case: A recursive function must contain a base case. This is a condition for the termination of execution.
    - Recursive case: The function keeps calling itself again and again until the base case is reached.
