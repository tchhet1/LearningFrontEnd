'this' - refers to the particular object instance that you are working with.

'this' in Arrow functions - inherited from the parent scope.

DO NOT USE ARROW FUNCTIONS IN THE BELOW CASE:
    const person2 = {
    age: 10,
    grow: () => {
        // error: *this* refers to the `Window` Object
        this.age++;
        console.log(this.age);
    }
    }
    person2.grow();




Default Function Argument:
    function calculatePrice(total, tax = 0.1, tip = 0.05){
    // When no value is given for tax or tip, the default 0.1 and 0.05 will be used
    return total + (total * tax) + (total * tip);
    }

With destructuring:
    function calculatePrice({
        total = 0,
        tax = 0.1,
        tip = 0.05} = {} ){
        console.log(total + (total * tax) + (total * tip));
    }

const bill = calculatePrice({ tip: 0.15, total:150 });

Functions in JavaScript, including constructor functions, are created with a prototype property, 
which is an object containing properties and methods that should be available to instances of a particular object type.
