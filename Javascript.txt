Data Types:
    Primitive - strings, number, boolean, null, undefined and symbol
    Object - array, key and value pair Object




A quick way of making a clone of an Object in JavaScript is to use Object.assign.


Operators:
&&= - x &&= y, only assigns if x is truthy.
||= - x ||= y, only assigns if x is falsy.
??=  - x ??= y, the value of y will be assigned to x only if x is null.
