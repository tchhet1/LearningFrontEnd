for vs forEach vs for ... of:

1. Simple For loop:
    - loops through the indices
    - Can start the loop from anywhere in the array
    - Can loop through every other element or skip as many elements
    - Can break out of the loop 
2. forEach
    - executes a provided function once for each array element.
    - loops through the element of the array.
    - forEach take two params (callback function and this argument).
    - can't break the loop early.
3. For ... of
    - loops through the element of the array.
    - will iterate over any of the iterables.
    - will start at the begining and loop through all the elements;
    - Can break out of the loop.
4. For ... in
    - will loop through object property
    


While vs Do While - Do While will run atleast once before it checks the condition. 


Break, Continue and nested Loop:

Break - will break the loop based on the given condition. The loop will no longer run. 

Continue - will skip the loop based the condition but the loop will continue.
