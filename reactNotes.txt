React Notes:
    - React Props are used to pass information down the component tree.
    - React state is used to make applications interactive. 
    - After the new state is set in a component, the component renders again, meaning the component function runs again.

*** Array destructuring is just a shorthand version of accessing each item one by one. 
If you express it without the array destructuring in React, it becomes less readable: ***

Component declaration - defining component 
Instance - using the defined component in other components
